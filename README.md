# incubyte_tdd_assessment

Hi There, I've completed this assessment using Javascript language and VS Code editor in Which I'm more comfortable with. Though TDD is new to me in terms of hands on, I was more comfortable yet challenging to work on it. And I'm hoping to learn more out of it along with you. Hoping to hear back from you.
